<h1 align="center"> Gowthaman Thirunavukkarasu</h1>
<p align="center"> Builder / Fixer / UX Advocate </p>
<p align="center">
    I've always seen technology as a tool to solve problems that matter, not just to build what's trending.<br />
    At my core, I like to fix inconsistencies, simplify what feels complicated, and make experiences feel clear and enjoyable.<br />
    Outside of work, I enjoy watching movies and taking long walks, and occasional runs.
